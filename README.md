# 💊 Drug Review Analytics & Insights Platform

## 🎯 Project Overview
A comprehensive data analytics platform that transforms raw patient drug reviews into actionable medical insights using advanced NLP and Generative AI LLM.

## 🚀 The Problem & Solution

### ❌ The Challenge
Patients and healthcare providers struggle to extract meaningful patterns from thousands of unstructured drug reviews, making it difficult to:
- Compare drug effectiveness and side effects

- **Analyzes 214K+ drug reviews** across 3,667 medications
- **Extracts 15+ medical properties** (drowsiness, pain relief, side effects, etc.)
- **Provides AI-powered summaries** of patient experiences
- **Delivers business-ready insights** through interactive dashboards
